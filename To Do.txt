To Do:

Make landscape shader
Simplify textures (grass, moss, bark) - look at Windwaker
Tree leaves
Simplify foliage with nice gradienting like Breath of the Wild?

Water shader (waterfall)

Rock>grass platforms - how to achieve edge blending?

Sound - material system

Wind - add period to lerp between noises for gusts of wind
